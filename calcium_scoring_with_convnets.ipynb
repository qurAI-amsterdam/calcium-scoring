    "A frequently performed task in various types of images is calcium scoring in computed tomography (CT) exams for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk prediction. Calcium scoring is routinely performed in non-contrast enhanced ECG-triggered cardiac CT, but increasingly applied in other CT exams visualizing the heart.\n",

    "\n",
    "In clinical practice, calcium scoring scans are dedicated cardiac scans with cardiac gating and a standardized axial resolution of 3mm slice thickness and 3mm slice spacing (i.e. non-overlapping slices). Chest CT scans are usually reconstructed to much thinner slices. In our dataset, the slice thickness ranged from 1mm to 3mm and the slice spacing from 0.6mm to 3mm. We therefore resampled the original images to a slice thickness of 3mm and a slice spacing of 1.5mm, which results in overlapping slices (which has been shown to improve the reproducibility of calcium scoring compared to the default 3mm spacing).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because images become softer with increasing slice thickness due to stronger partial volume effects, we immitated partial voluming by using a weighted average resampling strategy. For each new 3mm slice, the overlap with slices at the original resolution is determined and the values from each original slice are weighted accordingly:\n",

The first network analyzes the entire image and classifies all voxels above the standard calcium threshold (>= 130 HU) as either \"Background\" or as one of the calcium types (see list above). The second network analyzes all detected candidate calcium voxels again and classifies them as either \"no calcium\" (0) or \"calcium\" (1).\n",
